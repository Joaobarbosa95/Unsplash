	Express Body parser

- When submiting a form to server, express canÂ´t handle bodies except if a body parser is set (like the built in express.json()). 
Any other type, like the urlencoded submited with a form post method, needs a middleware body-parser (app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded)) 
so it can handle the info received in the body. If not, the req.body will be empty.


	
	Event Listener inside Event Listeners

- Event listeners will stack on top of one another, even it it is exactly the same event and function.
- So adding event listeners inside event listeners is a bad idea because every time you trigger the initial
event expecting to add events to the rest (form event to add events to submit or cancel buttons), will result 
in every time you open the form, a new event will be added to the buttons stacking the effect n + 1 times you 
triggered the form event.
	Ex: form.addEventListener("click", () => btn.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("1")))
		the second time you click form, it will add another event to btn, triggering 2 console.logs, 3 consoles 
		on the third, ...
