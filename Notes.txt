	Express Body parser

- When submiting a form to server, express canÂ´t handle bodies except if a body parser is set (like the built in express.json()). 
Any other type, like the urlencoded submited with a form post method, needs a middleware body-parser (app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded)) 
so it can handle the info received in the body. If not, the req.body will be empty.
